#### Brought to you by [case]hacks üíªüí°

> Congrats on wrapping up **CP164: Data Structures**! üéâ  
> You‚Äôve just leveled up your problem-solving and coding skills, now let‚Äôs add some more Git commands to your toolkit. This guide is part two of our GitHub basics series. If you‚Äôve already completed the [CP104 GitHub Basics](https://github.com/your-org/cp104-github-basics) on `push`, `add`, and `commit`, you‚Äôre in the right place.  
>  
> In this CP164 edition, you‚Äôll learn how to:
> - üåÄ **Fork** a repo (make your own copy on GitHub)  
> - üíª **Clone** it to your computer  
> - üîÅ **Pull** changes from the original repo  

Let‚Äôs go!

## What You‚Äôll Need
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your machine
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (optional, but helpful)
- Completed CP104 GitHub basics or basic knowledge of Git

---

## Step 1: Fork this repository  

<details>
<summary>ü§î What does <code>fork</code> mean?</summary>

Forking means making a **copy of someone else's repository** to your own GitHub account.

This is useful when:
- You want to contribute to a project without affecting the original.
- You need your own workspace to make changes.
- You want to sync updates from the original repo later (see: `pull`).

</details>

1. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
2. Now you‚Äôll see your own version: `your-username/cp164-github-basics`.


## Step 2: Clone your fork  

<details>
<summary>ü§î What does <code>clone</code> mean?</summary>

Cloning means **downloading a GitHub repository to your own computer** so you can edit files locally.

You‚Äôll use this command so you can make changes using your code editor.

</details>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cp164-github-basics.git
cd cp164-github-basics
```

## Step 3: Check your remote

<details>
<summary>ü§î What is a <code>remote</code>?</summary>

A remote is a version of your project that's hosted somewhere else ‚Äî like GitHub.

- `origin`: your personal copy (fork)
- `upstream`: the original repo you forked from

You can use Git commands to sync between them.

</details>

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:

```
origin  https://github.com/your-username/cp164-github-basics.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-username/cp164-github-basics.git (push)
```


## Step 4: Connect to the original repo  

<details>
<summary>ü§î What does <code>upstream</code> mean?</summary>

`upstream` refers to the **original repo you forked from**. You use this to pull in updates that have been made to the original project.

This helps you stay in sync!

</details>

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/casehacks/cp164-github-basics.git
```

Then confirm:

```bash
git remote -v
```


## Step 5: Pull changes from upstream  

<details>
<summary>ü§î What does <code>pull</code> mean?</summary>

Pulling means **downloading and merging changes** from a remote repository into your current branch.

You usually pull from:
- `origin` (your fork)
- or `upstream` (the original)

</details>

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```


## Step 6: Make changes & commit  

<details>
<summary>ü§î What does <code>commit</code> mean?</summary>

A commit is a saved snapshot of your changes. Think of it like hitting "Save + Version History" at the same time.

</details>

```bash
echo "hello from cp164!" >> sample.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Added my greeting"
```

## Step 7: Push your changes  

<details>
<summary>ü§î What does <code>push</code> mean?</summary>

Pushing sends your commits (saved changes) from your computer back to your fork on GitHub.

</details>

```bash
git push origin main
```

## You did it!
You‚Äôve now completed both **parts of GitHub basics** with [case]hacks:
- ‚úÖ CP104: Push, Add, Commit  
- ‚úÖ CP164: Clone, Fork, Pull  

You're well on your way to collaborating like a pro.
